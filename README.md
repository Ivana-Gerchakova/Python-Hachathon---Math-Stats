# Project Title :
Python Hackathon Math & Stats Project.

## Project Overview :
In this project, we analyzed two datasets containing information from a study involving 100 patients. 
The primary focus was on measuring elevated blood pressure, investigating medication usage, and understanding the overall impact on the patient's health. 
The goal was to assess the effectiveness of the administered medication and explore potential differences in blood pressure between the first day and after a 6-month period.

## Project Highlights :
- **Dataset Details:** The project utilized two datasets comprising information from 100 patients, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of blood pressure and medication-related factors.
  
- **Medication Efficacy:** The analysis, including tests, hypotheses, and model predictions, suggests that the administered medication shows effectiveness for patients with elevated blood pressure.

- **Temporal Blood Pressure Changes:** Initial findings indicate a potential difference in blood pressure measurements between the first day and the 6-month mark. However, further confirmation is needed, considering various factors influencing the patients' current health
